# Mobility Data Collection and Processing

## Project Overview
This repository contains my work for Lab 2: Collecting Mobility Data as part of the AMI23K course. The assignment focuses on the collection, quality assessment, and processing of mobility data to understand human mobility patterns, urban mobility models, and transportation studies. This lab emphasizes handling raw GPS data, transforming it into a usable format, and performing various calculations and visualizations.

## Lab Objectives
- **Task 1: GPS Data Processing**
  - Convert raw GPS data into a readable format.
  - Preprocess data to include proper IDs, calculate speed, distance, time differences, and acceleration.
  - Output processed data in CSV or XLSX format.

- **Task 2: Data Visualization**
  - Visualize the processed GPS data points (longitude vs. latitude).
  - Create a heatmap to demonstrate the density of GPS data points in a specific area.

## Methodology and Tools
- Utilized Python and Tableau for data processing and visualization tasks.
- Employed Excel for initial data importing and manipulation.
- Applied various libraries for calculations and geographic visualizations.
